They should be brittle to the touch and free from any discoloration or mold. Break them into smaller, manageable pieces and set aside. If the pieces are too large (malalaki), you can gently crumble them using clean, dry hands (malinis at tuyong kamay). | Heat canola oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot (makapal na kaldero) over medium heat (katamtamang init). Once hot, add your minced garlic (bawang), chopped onions (sibuyas), and ginger (luya).

Still avoid stirring vigorously. Continue cooking for about 25 minutes more, or until the leaves have significantly darkened and softened. | Add the coconut cream (kakang gata) and continue simmering.

If you don't have a thermometer, test the oil by dropping a small piece of bread - it should turn golden brown within 30 seconds. | Very carefully lower the pork leg into the hot oil using long tongs or a spider strainer. The oil will bubble vigorously (bubula) - this is normal. Keep the oil temperature between 160-175C (320-350F). Cook for 20-30 minutes, maintaining consistent heat and occasionally rotating the pork leg for even cooking. The skin should turn a deep golden brown and become very crispy (malutong). | Remove the pork leg from the oil when the skin is crispy and golden.

Pour 1/4 cup of Datu Puti vinegar over the onions and let them sit while you prepare the mushrooms, about 20 minutes until they turn pink. This mellows the raw onion flavor while adding a nice tangy brightness. | Preheat your oven to 375F (190C). Wash and thoroughly dry your mushrooms  this is important for proper roasting. Arrange the mushrooms in a single layer on a baking sheet, making sure not to overcrowd them. Use two baking sheets if needed. Drizzle approximately 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil over the mushrooms and season generously with salt and pepper. | Roast the mushrooms for 10 minutes, then take them out and flip them over. Continue roasting for another 10 minutes until they're golden brown and slightly crispy at the edges. Remove from the oven and let them cool to room temperature. Once cooled, chop the mushrooms into small, bite-sized pieces and transfer them to a large mixing bowl. | To the bowl of chopped roasted mushrooms, add 4 tablespoons of the pickled onions including some of the vinegar, 2 tablespoons coconut aminos, 2 tablespoons calamansi juice, 1 tablespoon vegan mayonnaise, and 1 tablespoon of chopped chives or green onion.

Use paper towels to pat them completely dry (kailangang tuyuin ng mabuti gamit ang paper towel). Rub kosher salt evenly across all pieces of chicken (pahiran ng asin ang bawat piraso ng manok), making sure to get under the skin when possible. Let the salted chicken rest at room temperature for 15 minutes (palamiginin ng labinlimang minuto). | While the chicken is resting, prepare your poaching liquid (maghanda ng sabaw na papakuluan). In a deep pot or Dutch oven, combine your chicken stock, light soy sauce (manipis na toyo), dark soy sauce (maitim na toyo), Shaoxing wine, and brown sugar (asukal na kayumanggi). Add your aromatics: the whole star anise (sangke), cinnamon stick (kanela), crushed garlic cloves (durog na bawang), sliced ginger (hiwang luya), and black pepper (paminta). Set your stove to high heat and bring this mixture to a boil at 200C. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low (about 160C) and let it simmer for 5 minutes until the liquid becomes fragrant (hanggang mabango). | Gently lower your chicken pieces into the simmering liquid (dahan-dahang ilagay ang manok sa mainit na sabaw). The liquid temperature will drop - wait until it returns to a gentle simmer at 180C. Reduce the heat to maintain a steady temperature of 160C. Cook the chicken for 20-25 minutes, occasionally turning the pieces for even cooking (paikutin paminsan-minsan ang manok para maluto ng pantay). The chicken is done when a thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165F or 74C (luto na ang manok kapag umabot sa 74C ang init sa loob). | Remove the chicken from the poaching liquid using tongs (hanguin ang manok gamit ang sipit). Place them on a wire rack and pat them thoroughly dry with paper towels (patuyuing mabuti gamit ang paper towel). This drying step is crucial for achieving crispy skin (importanteng hakbang ito para maging malutong ang balat). Place the rack with the chicken in your refrigerator, uncovered (ilagay sa ref nang hindi natatakpan), and let it air dry for 6-12 hours or overnight. The cold air helps dehydrate the skin, which will make it extra crispy when fried. | When ready to fry, remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to take the chill off (ilabas sa ref tatlumpung minuto bago prituhin). Heat your frying oil in a deep pot to exactly 350F or 177C (initin ang mantika hanggang 177C). Carefully lower the chicken pieces into the hot oil (dahan-dahang ihulog ang manok sa mainit na mantika). Maintain the oil temperature between 325F and 350F (163C-177C) - use your thermometer to monitor this carefully. Fry each piece for 3-5 minutes per side until the skin is deeply golden brown and crispy (hanggang maging golden brown at malutong ang balat). | Transfer the fried chicken to a clean wire rack to drain excess oil (patuyuan ng mantika sa parilya). Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before serving (palamiginin ng 5-10 minuto bago ihain). This resting period allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring each bite is juicy (para manatiling malambot at malasa ang karne). | Serve hot with steamed rice (mainit na kanin) and your choice of dipping sauce. A mix of vinegar, soy sauce, and chili (suka, toyo, at sili) makes an excellent accompaniment. If storing leftovers, let the chicken cool completely before refrigerating in an airtight container (palamiginin bago ilagay sa lalagyan at iref). Leftovers will stay crispy when reheated in an oven at 400F (200C) for 10-15 minutes or in an air fryer at 370F (188C) for 5-7 minutes. | Remember that the key to perfect crispy skin lies in thorough drying (ang susi sa malutong na balat ay ang maayos na pagpapatuyo) and maintaining proper oil temperature during frying (at ang tamang init ng mantika sa pagpiprito). If your chicken browns too quickly, your oil is too hot. If it takes longer than 5 minutes per side to brown, your oil isn't hot enough. Always use your thermometer to ensure perfect results (palaging gamitin ang termometro para sa perpektong resulta).",chicken | water sabaw ng manok | light soy sauce soy sauce | dark soy sauce soy sauce | chinese rice wine | brown sugar asukal na kayumanggi | whole star anise sangke | cinnamon kanela | ginger | black pepper paminta | deep frying mantika

Using clean hands, gently massage (magmasahe) the marinade into the meat to ensure even coating. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight for best results (mas masarap kung overnight). | Thirty minutes before cooking, remove the chicken from the refrigerator to come to room temperature (hayaang umabot sa tamang temperatura). Drain the chicken but save the marinade (itabi ang pinagbabaran)  we'll use this later. | Heat your oil (mantika) in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat (350F/175C). Test if the oil is hot enough by dropping a small piece of potato  it should sizzle immediately. Fry your potato rounds until they turn golden brown (hanggang maging golden brown), about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove them to a paper towel-lined plate (patuyuin sa paper towel). Leave just 1 tablespoon of oil in the pan. | Increase the heat to medium-high (375F/190C). Place your marinated chicken pieces skin-side down (balat sa ibaba) in the pan.

Cover the pot and let it cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and reaches an internal temperature of 165F/74C.

Continue cooking uncovered until the sauce has reduced and thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon (hanggang lumapot ang sarsa). This usually takes about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt (asin) if needed. If you find it too sour, you can add a small amount of brown sugar (asukal na pula) to balance the flavors. | Let your adobo rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Check occasionally and add more broth if needed to keep the meat partially submerged. | When the beef is nearly tender (internal temperature around 190F/88C), add back the browned potatoes and carrots. Continue cooking for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender but not mushy (malambot pero hindi masyadong luto). | Add the bell peppers (paminta) in the last 5 minutes of cooking. The beef should be fork-tender at this point, reaching an internal temperature of 200-205F (93-96C).

Cook for 1 hour, allowing the beef to become tender and the watermelon to infuse the broth with sweetness. | Add the peeled taro roots and continue simmering for 30 minutes until they're tender when pierced with a fork. The taro will help thicken the broth naturally. | Add the sinigang mix or, if using fresh tamarind, squeeze the muslin bag several times to extract all the juice.

Take your sharp knife (kutsilyo) and make a careful butterfly cut along the belly of the fish, opening it flat like a book. Remove all the internal organs (tanggalin ang mga lamang-loob) and rinse the fish thoroughly under cold running water. | Next, locate the backbone of your butterflied bangus. Starting from the head, gently pull the backbone toward the tail to remove it completely. Use tweezers to carefully remove any remaining small bones (mga maliliit na tinik). Once deboned, rinse the fish again and pat it completely dry using paper towels (tuyuin ng mabuti gamit ang paper towel). | In a large non-metal bowl, prepare your marinade by combining one cup of Filipino vinegar, five crushed cloves of garlic (dinurog na bawang), one teaspoon of cracked black peppercorns (dinurog na paminta), and one teaspoon of salt (asin). If you enjoy spicy food, you may add crushed Thai chilies (dinurog na siling labuyo). Mix these ingredients well until the salt dissolves completely. | Place your prepared bangus in a shallow container (lalagyan) and pour the marinade over it, making sure the fish is completely covered by the solution (siguruhing nalulubog ang isda sa marinade). Cover the container and place it in your refrigerator set at 4C/39F. Let the fish marinate for at least 8 hours or overnight, but do not exceed 12 hours as this can make the fish too soft (malambot). | When you're ready to cook, remove the marinated fish from the refrigerator. Take the bangus out of the marinade and pat it very dry with paper towels (tuyuin ng mabuti). This step is crucial for achieving crispy skin (magkaroon ng malutong na balat). | Heat your frying pan (initin ang kawali) and add enough cooking oil to cover half the thickness of the fish. The oil must reach exactly 180C/350F before frying. If you don't have a thermometer, test the oil by inserting a wooden chopstick - the oil should bubble steadily around it but not too vigorously. | Carefully place your bangus in the hot oil (maingat na ilagay ang bangus sa mainit na mantika). Let it fry undisturbed for 3-5 minutes until the bottom side turns golden brown. Using tongs (sipit), carefully flip the fish only once and cook the other side for another 3-5 minutes. The internal temperature should reach 63C/145F for food safety. | Once cooked, lift the fish from the oil using your tongs and let it drain on paper towels (patuyuin sa paper towel) to remove excess oil. The skin should be crispy and golden brown, while the flesh inside remains moist and flaky. | Serve your daing na bangus immediately while hot (ihain habang mainit pa) with garlic rice (sinangag), fried egg (pritong itlog), and a side of tomato and onion salad (ensaladang kamatis at sibuyas). Prepare a dipping sauce (sawsawan) by combining vinegar with crushed garlic, cracked black pepper, and chili peppers if desired. | If you have leftover cooked daing na bangus, let it cool completely before storing in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep well for up to three days. When reheating, warm it in a pan over low heat (mahinang apoy) with a small amount of oil, or in an air fryer at 180C for 3-4 minutes. Avoid using the microwave as this will make the fish rubbery (makunat).",whole bangus milkfish bangus | coconut vinegar | garlic bawang | whole black peppercorns pamintang buo | salt asin | thai chily

Pat them dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, mince both organs very finely (tinadtad)  each piece should be no larger than 1/4 inch. This fine mincing is crucial for achieving the right texture. | Place the minced organs in a bowl and combine with native vinegar (suka) and salt (asin). Let this mixture marinate for 20 minutes at room temperature. This step helps remove any gamey smell (lansa) from the meat. | While the meat marinates, prepare your vegetables. Finely dice the white onion (sibuyas) and mince the garlic (bawang). Cut the carrots (karot) into small, uniform cubes. Chop the green and red bell peppers (siling pangsigang) into small pieces. Finely chop the Thai chili peppers (siling labuyo). | Set a heavy-bottom pan or cast iron skillet (kawali) over medium-high heat (180C/350F). Add cooking oil (mantika) and wait until it begins to shimmer. Add the diced onions and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until they become translucent (malinaw). Add the minced garlic and cook for 2 minutes more until fragrant (mabango). | Add the marinated meat mixture to the pan. Cook at medium heat (160C/320F) for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally (haluin paminsan-minsan) to prevent the meat from sticking to the bottom. The liquid will gradually reduce during this time. | As the liquid reduces, you'll notice the meat starting to brown. Continue cooking until you hear the signature crackling sound (pulutok). This is a crucial stage that indicates the dish is developing its characteristic texture. The oil will begin to separate and form small orange droplets. | Once you hear the consistent pulutok sound, add the carrots first and cook for 3 minutes. Then add both the bell peppers and Thai chilies. Cook everything together at medium heat (160C/320F) until the vegetables are tender-crisp, about 3-5 minutes more. | Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional fish sauce (patis) and vinegar if needed. The final dish should have a perfect balance of spicy and tangy flavors, with slightly crispy edges (magaspang) while remaining tender (malambot) in the center. | If serving as pulutan, transfer to a sizzling plate and serve immediately with ice-cold beer and spiced vinegar (sawsawang suka) on the side. If serving as a main dish, plate with steaming white rice (mainit na kanin) and garnish with fresh tomato and onion ensalada. | For storing, let the bopis cool completely before transferring to an airtight container. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When reheating, use a pan over medium heat (160C/320F) with a small amount of oil until you hear the pulutok sound again. Never use a microwave, as this will make the meat tough and rubbery. | If your bopis becomes too dry (masyadong tuyo) during cooking, add 2-3 tablespoons of water or stock and reduce heat to 150C/300F. If it's too wet (masyadong malabnaw), increase heat to 190C/375F and continue cooking until the excess liquid evaporates and you achieve the desired consistency.",pork lungs baga ng baboy | pork heart | vinegar suka | salt asin | canola oil mantika | fish sauce fish sauce | carrot | bell pepper | thai chili pepper

Allow the meat to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. | Heat your pot over high heat (200C/400F). Add cooking oil (mantika) and wait until it starts to shimmer. Carefully place the pork leg in the hot oil and sear each side until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side [Iprito ang bawat gilid hanggang maging golden brown]. Remove the pork and set aside on a clean plate. | In the same pot over medium-high heat (180C/350F), combine the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce (toyo), white vinegar (suka), and brown sugar (asukal na pula). Add the star anise (sangke) and water (tubig). Stir the mixture until the sugar completely dissolves [Haluin hanggang matunaw ang asukal]. Bring this mixture to a gentle boil. | Return the seared pork leg to the pot. Add the halved garlic head (bawang), sliced ginger (luya), and bay leaves (dahon ng laurel). Once the liquid returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low (150C/300F) to maintain a gentle simmer [Pahinain ang apoy]. Cover the pot with a lid. | Let the pork cook for 2 to 2.5 hours, turning it every 30 minutes to ensure even cooking [Baliktarin ang karne tuwing 30 minuto]. The liquid should be gently bubbling, never at a rolling boil. If the liquid reduces too much, add hot water half a cup at a time. | When the meat is nearly tender, about 30 minutes before finishing, add the shiitake mushrooms (kabute) to the pot. The mushrooms will absorb the flavorful broth while cooking. | Check the meat's tenderness by inserting a fork  it should enter easily with minimal resistance [Subukan ang lambot ng karne gamit ang tinidor]. The meat should be very tender but still holding its shape. | Blanch the bok choy (pechay baguio) separately in boiling water for 2-3 minutes until tender-crisp [Pakuluan ng saglit ang pechay]. Remove and set aside. | Once the meat is fully tender, carefully transfer it to a serving platter. If the sauce seems too thin, strain it and return it to the pot. Simmer the sauce over medium heat until it reaches your desired consistency [Palaputan ang sarsa kung kinakailangan]. The sauce should coat the back of a spoon. | Arrange the blanched bok choy and cooked mushrooms around the pork leg. Pour the hot sauce over the meat and vegetables. | Serve the Pata Tim immediately while hot with steaming white rice (mainit na kanin). Offer additional sauce in a separate bowl for those who want extra [Maghain ng dagdag na sarsa]. | For best results, let the entire dish rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to settle [Pahintulutin muna ang lutong magsettle bago ihain]. This also makes it easier to portion the meat, which should now be tender enough to cut with minimal effort. | If you plan to serve it the next day, let the dish cool completely before refrigerating. When reheating, do so gently over low heat (150C/300F), adding a small amount of water if needed to maintain the sauce's consistency [Painitin ng dahan-dahan at magdagdag ng kaunting tubig kung kinakailangan].",the main dish | whole pork leg pata | wine | premium soy sauce | brown sugar | whole star anise | the vegetable | shiitake mushroom | bok choy | dried bay | whole garlic halved | ginger

Cut the pork tenderloin and beef liver (atay) into half-inch strips. Thinly slice the onion (sibuyas) and mince the garlic (bawang). Cut the red bell pepper into strips. Set aside the green peas (gisantes). This preparation is called ""mise en place"". | In a large glass or non-reactive bowl, combine the sliced pork with vinegar (suka), soy sauce (toyo), sliced onions, minced garlic, bay leaves (dahon ng laurel), and cracked black peppercorns (dinurog na paminta). Let the meat marinate at room temperature (27C/80F) for 20 minutes. This process is called pagpapaalat. | After marination, drain the meat but save the marinade liquid and aromatics separately. You will need these later for the sauce (sarsa). | Heat your cooking oil (mantika) in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat (180C/350F). When the oil is hot, quickly stir-fry the bell pepper strips for 30 seconds until they slightly blister. Remove the peppers and set them aside. | Using the same pan and oil, add the marinated pork (not the liver yet). Cook until the meat changes color from pink to light brown, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved onions, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves from the marinade. Continue cooking until the onions become soft and translucent (malinaw). | Pour in the reserved marinade liquid and bring it to a full boil over high heat (100C/212F). This is a crucial step - do not stir the mixture for 4-5 minutes after it starts boiling. This technique, called pagpapakulo ng suka, helps develop the sauce's flavor. | Add half a cup of water to the pan and bring the mixture back to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to medium-low (160C/320F), cover the pan, and let it simmer for 25-30 minutes. The pork should become tender during this time (dapat lumambot ang karne). | When the pork is tender, add the liver strips to the pan, maintaining medium heat (170C/340F). Gently stir the liver and cook for 4-5 minutes until just done. The liver should still be slightly pink inside to remain tender (dapat medyo pink pa sa loob). | Add the green peas to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until they turn bright green. Return the reserved bell peppers to the pan and cook for another 1-2 minutes to heat them through. | Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt (asin) if needed. Remove the bay leaves before serving. | For the best results, let the igado rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This resting period allows the flavors to settle and the meat to reabsorb some of the sauce. | Serve your igado hot with steamed white rice (mainit na kanin). Traditional accompaniments include pickled green papaya (atchara), sliced fresh tomatoes (kamatis), and fish sauce (patis) on the side. | Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator (4C/40F) for up to 3-4 days.

Once boiling, reduce heat to low (150C/300F) and let it simmer for 30 minutes, or until the pork becomes tender when pierced with a fork. | Here comes the crucial step: slowly pour in the pig's blood while continuously stirring in one direction. Keep the heat low (140C/285F) and maintain a gentle simmer for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the sauce from sticking to the bottom. The blood should thicken the sauce without forming any lumps. | Season with salt and black pepper to taste. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. If it's too thick, add water little by little while stirring. If too thin, simmer for a few more minutes. | Let everything rest for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to settle and the sauce to achieve the perfect consistency.

If some pieces are thicker than others, gently pound them with a meat mallet until they're even. | Mix your marinade in a bowl: combine sugar, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and red food coloring if you're using it. Add your sliced pork and massage everything together with your hands for 5 minutes. Really work the marinade into each piece of meat. Every slice should be well-coated with the mixture. | Put your marinated meat in a container with a tight lid or a zip-top bag. Place it in the refrigerator and let it cure for at least 8 hours, but overnight is best. Don't leave it for more than 24 hours. | When you're ready to cook, take out your marinated pork and put it in a pan. Add 1 cup of water and turn the heat to medium. Let it simmer with the lid on until the meat is tender and most of the water has evaporated  this usually takes about 15-20 minutes. | Once most of the water is gone, add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil. Keep cooking and stirring until the meat starts to caramelize and turn golden brown around the edges. This should take about 5-7 minutes. You'll know it's done when the edges are slightly crispy and darkened, but the meat is still juicy inside. | Let your tocino rest for 5 minutes before serving. This keeps the meat juicy. Serve hot with garlic fried rice and a sunny-side-up egg for traditional tocilog. Don't forget to put some chopped tomatoes and vinegar on the side. | For any leftovers, let them cool completely before storing. They'll keep in the fridge for 3-4 days. When you want to reheat, just add a tiny splash of water to the pan to keep the meat moist while it warms up.",1 4 thick | garlic powder | red food coloring | pineapple juice | anise wine pang | powder natural food coloring

Place the bowl in the refrigerator set at 4C/39F and marinate for exactly 30 minutes - no longer, as the acid can start breaking down the meat too much. | While the meat marinates, prepare your aromatics. Slice your onion (sibuyas) finely and mince your garlic (bawang). Set your stove to medium heat (175C/350F) and place your heavy-bottom pot or Dutch oven (kaldero) on the burner. Add your cooking oil (mantika) and let it heat up until it shimmers. | Add your sliced onions to the hot oil and cook them until they become transparent and soft, about 2-3 minutes. Add your minced garlic and cook for another minute until you can smell its aroma. Remove your marinated pork from the refrigerator and drain it, but save the marinade - you'll need it later. | Add your drained pork to the pot and cook until it develops a light brown color on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Pour in your reserved marinade and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, add your whole peppercorns (paminta) and bay leaves (dahon ng laurel). | Now add your rinsed tausi, pineapple chunks (pinya), and the soaked banana blossoms to the pot. Reduce your heat to low (150C/300F) and cover the pot. Let everything simmer together, giving it a gentle stir every 20 minutes or so. The meat needs to cook slowly for about 1.5 to 2 hours until it becomes tender enough to cut with just your fork. | After about an hour of cooking, add your brown sugar (asukal na pula). Continue cooking until the sauce has reduced and thickened - it should coat the back of your wooden spoon (sandok na kahoy). You'll know your humba is ready when you see clear oil pools forming on the surface, the meat easily falls apart when pressed, and the internal temperature of the meat reaches 90C/195F. | Once done, remove the pot from heat and let your humba rest for 15 minutes. This resting time allows the meat to become even more tender and lets the flavors settle. Serve your humba hot over steaming white rice (kanin). | For storing leftover humba, let it cool completely before transferring to an airtight container. It will keep in your refrigerator at 4C/39F for up to 4 days. When reheating, warm it gently on the stove over medium-low heat until it reaches 74C/165F throughout. Add a small amount of water if the sauce has become too thick. | If you want to freeze your humba, place it in a freezer-safe container and store at -18C/0F for up to 2 months. When ready to eat, thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating using the method described above. | Remember that humba tastes even better the next day, as the flavors continue to develop and deepen overnight. This makes it an excellent dish to prepare in advance for special occasions or family gatherings.",pork | vinegar suka | soy sauce soy sauce | pineapple juice katas ng pinya | oil mantika | onion sibuya | garlic bawang | whole peppercorns pamintum | dahon ng laurel | black bean | pineapple chunks pinya | dried banana blossoms puso ng | brown sugar asukal na pula

While the oil is heating, prepare your chicken pieces and ensure all vegetables are cut and ready. | Place the quartered potatoes (patatas) in the hot oil and brown them until they develop a golden color on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes and set them aside on a plate (itabi muna ang patatas). | Lower the heat to medium (160C/320F). In the same pan, add your thinly sliced onions (sibuyas), minced garlic (bawang), and julienned ginger (luya). This combination is called gulay na pampalasa in Tagalog. Saut these aromatics until they become fragrant and the onions turn translucent (hanggang maging malambot ang sibuyas), about 2-3 minutes. | Add your chicken pieces (manok) to the pan with the aromatics. Allow the chicken to brown properly for 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking. Pour in the fish sauce (patis) and cook for another minute to let the flavors meld. | Now comes the crucial step of adding your coconut milk (gata). Pour in both cans of coconut milk along with the half cup of water (tubig). Add your Thai chili peppers (siling labuyo). Bring this mixture to a very gentle simmer over low heat (140C/285F). Remember, hindi dapat kumulo nang malakas - the coconut milk should never boil vigorously as this will cause it to separate or curdle (mawawala ang gata). | Cover the pan and let everything cook together for 20-25 minutes. The sauce should be gently bubbling, and you'll notice it starting to thicken. This slow cooking ensures the chicken becomes tender (malambot) and the coconut milk reduces to the right consistency (tamang lapot). | Return your browned potatoes to the pan and add both the red and green bell peppers (paminta). Continue cooking for 5 more minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender (madaling matusok ng tinidor) and the peppers are slightly softened but still crisp. | Make your final taste adjustments by adding salt (asin) and pepper (paminta) according to your preference (ayon sa panlasa). Once seasoned, remove the pan from heat and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. This resting period allows the flavors to settle and develop (para lalong sumarap). | For the best experience, serve your Ginataang Manok hot over freshly steamed rice (mainit na kanin). The dish should have a creamy, slightly thick sauce with tender chicken that easily comes off the bone. You should see small orange droplets of oil on the surface - this is a sign of perfectly cooked gata. | If your sauce becomes too thick while resting, you can thin it out with a small amount of hot water (mainit na tubig). If it's too thin, simmer uncovered for a few more minutes until it reaches your desired consistency (hanggang sa lapot na gusto mo). | Remember to store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator (ref).

Mix these ingredients well until the salt completely dissolves (Paghaluin ang toyo, katas ng kalamansi, dinurog na bawang, kinayod na luya, paminta, at asin sa isang malaking mangkok. Haluing mabuti hanggang matunaw ang asin). | Take your chicken pieces and place them in the marinade. Massage the marinade into the meat to ensure even coating (Ilagay ang mga piraso ng manok sa pinagbabaran. Masahihin ang pinagbabaran sa karne para pantay ang pagkakahalo). Make sure all pieces are submerged in the liquid. | Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and place in the refrigerator. Let the chicken marinate for at least 8 hours or overnight for best results (Takpan ang mangkok at ilagay sa refrigerator. Ibabad ng hindi bababa sa 8 oras o magdamag para sa pinakamainam na resulta). | After marination, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature, about 30 minutes (Pagkatapos ibabad, ilabas ang manok sa refrigerator at hayaang umabot sa room temperature, mga 30 minuto). | While waiting, prepare your coating mixture. Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Mix thoroughly (Ihalo ang harina, cornstarch, baking powder, pulbos na bawang, pulbos na sibuyas, asin, at paminta sa isang mababaw na pinggan.

This step is crucial for achieving crispy skin. | Heat your cooking oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot to 350F/175C (Initin ang mantika sa isang malalim na kawali hanggang umabot sa 350F/175C). Use a cooking thermometer for accuracy. | While the oil heats, begin the double-dredging process. Take each dried chicken piece and coat thoroughly in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Let these pieces rest for 5 minutes on a wire rack (Ibalot ang bawat pirasong manok sa harina, ipagpag ang sobra. Ipahinga ng 5 minuto sa wire rack). | After resting, dredge each piece again in the flour mixture for extra crispiness (Ibalot muli ang bawat piraso sa harina para sa dagdag na lutong). | Once the oil reaches temperature, carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot (Maingat na ilagay ang mga piraso ng manok sa mainit na mantika, siguraduhing hindi masyadong marami sa isang pagpiprito). | Fry the chicken for 12-15 minutes on the first side (Iprito ang manok ng 12-15 minuto). The coating should be turning golden brown and crispy. | Carefully flip each piece and continue frying for another 10-12 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165F/74C (Maingat na baliktarin ang bawat piraso at iprito ng 10-12 minuto pa o hanggang umabot ang loob sa 165F/74C). | Remove the chicken from the oil and place on a wire rack to drain, not on paper towels (Alisin ang manok sa mantika at ilagay sa wire rack para tumulo, hindi sa paper towel). This keeps the coating crispy. | Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before serving (Ipahinga ang manok ng 5-10 minuto bago ihain). This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. | Serve hot with steamed white rice (kanin) and your choice of banana ketchup, spiced vinegar (suka), or toyomansi dipping sauce (Ihain ng mainit kasama ng kanin at banana ketchup, suka, o toyomansi sawsawan). | For storage, let cool completely then refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days (Para sa pag-iimbak, hayaang lumamig nang husto bago ilagay sa sealed container at ilagay sa refrigerator.

Pat them completely dry using paper towels (tuyuin ng mabuti gamit ang paper towel). Let them reach room temperature (27C/80F) if they were refrigerated. This ensures even cooking (para pantay ang pagkakaluto). | Prepare all your ingredients before starting: finely chop the onion (tadtarin ang sibuyas), mince the garlic (dikdikin ang bawang), and julienne the ginger (hiwain ng pahaba ang luya). Having everything ready makes the cooking process smooth and prevents overcooking (para hindi lumambot masyado ang talaba). | Set your stove to medium heat (katamtamang init or 180C/350F). Place your heavy-bottom pan or kawali over the heat. Pour the canola oil and wait for it to become hot but not smoking. Add the butter and allow it to melt completely, swirling the pan to combine with the oil. | Once the butter has melted, add your chopped onions to the pan. Cook them for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent. You don't want them to brown, just to soften and become fragrant. | Add the minced garlic and julienned ginger to the pan. Cook for one minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning (haluin palagi para hindi masunog). The garlic should become fragrant but not brown (mabango pero hindi kulay brown ang bawang). | Gently add your cleaned oysters to the pan. Saut them carefully for one minute, moving them around the pan with a gentle hand (igisa ng marahan). Remember that oysters are delicate and don't need much cooking. | Pour in your Filipino soy sauce or toyo. Add the black pepper (paminta) and Thai chilies if using. Cook for another minute, gently stirring to coat the oysters with the sauce (haluing mabuti para mabalutan ng sarsa ang talaba). | Lower the heat to medium-low (hinaan ang apoy or 160C/320F). Pour in the calamansi juice. Let everything simmer gently for 2-3 minutes until the sauce reduces slightly (pakuluan hanggang lumapot ng kaunti ang sarsa). Avoid stirring too much at this point to keep the oysters tender. | Taste your sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt (asin) if needed. Remember that soy sauce is already salty, so add salt carefully (mag-ingat sa paglalagay ng asin dahil maalat na ang toyo). | Turn off the heat once the sauce has slightly thickened and the oysters are just cooked through. They should be plump and tender, not shrunken or rubbery (dapat malaman at malambot ang talaba, hindi kumukulubot o matigas). | Serve your Adobong Talaba immediately while hot (ihain habang mainit pa) over steaming white rice (mainit na kanin). For the best experience, have some patis (fish sauce) on the side and garnish with fresh calamansi halves if available. | If you need to store leftovers, let them cool to room temperature first, then place in an airtight container. Keep in the refrigerator for up to three days.

Slowly pour in the coconut milk (gata) and water while gently stirring. Remember, gentle heat is key to prevent the coconut milk from curdling (dahan-dahan sa pagbubuhos ng gata para hindi maging buo-buo). | Bring the liquid to a gentle simmer - you should see small bubbles, but it shouldn't be boiling rapidly). Cover the pot and let it cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and easily pulls away from the bone. | Return the potatoes and carrots to the pot.

This helps the meat brown better and cook more evenly. | Heat your large pan or kawali over medium heat (katamtamang init, 176C/350F). Once the pan feels hot when you hold your hand above it, add the cooking oil (mantika) and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. | Add your minced garlic (dinurog na bawang) and ginger (luya) to the hot oil. Gently stir them around the pan until you smell their aroma (hanggang lumabas ang mabangong samyo), about 30-45 seconds. Be careful not to let them burn (huwag hayaang masunog) as this will make your dish bitter. | Add your ground beef (giniling na baka) to the pan. Break it apart with your spatula or sandok into small, even pieces. Let the meat cook over medium-high heat (malakas-katamtamang init, 190C/375F) until it starts to brown. This will take about 5-7 minutes. Avoid stirring too frequently to allow the meat to develop a nice caramelized color. | While the meat is cooking, prepare your sauce. In a bowl, combine your low-sodium soy sauce (toyo), brown sugar (asukal na pula), sesame oil, and red pepper flakes. Mix well until the sugar dissolves (hanggang matunaw ang asukal). | Once the meat has browned, you can drain off excess fat if desired (pwedeng alisin ang sobrang mantika).

Authentic Ginataang Alimasag (Filipino Crab in Coconut Milk),25 minutes,40 minutes,1 hours 5 minutes,6,6 blue crabs alimasag | 4 cups coconut milk gata | 1 cup coconut cream kakang gata | 1 onion chopped (sibuyas) | 5 cloves garlic minced (bawang) | 1 thumb-size ginger julienned (luya) | 4 Thai chili peppers siling labuyo | 1 tablespoon fish sauce patis | 1 small calabasa/squash cubed (kalabasa) | 1 bunch long beans cut into 2-inch lengths (sitaw) | 1 tablespoon cooking oil mantika | Salt and pepper to taste asin at paminta,"Start by thoroughly cleaning the crabs (alimasag) under running water. Remove the gills (hasang) and innards (bituka) carefully. Lightly scrub the shells to remove any dirt or debris (kuskusin ang shell para matanggal ang dumi). Check that each crab feels heavy for its size - this ensures you're using meaty crabs. | Fill your steamer with water and bring it to a full boil at 212F (100C). Place the cleaned crabs belly-side down in the steamer basket, making sure they're not overcrowded. Steam the crabs for 20-25 minutes until their shells turn bright orange-red. You'll know they're done when the shells have completely changed color (kapag naging orange-pula na ang balat). | While the crabs are steaming, prepare your vegetables. Chop the onions (sibuyas), mince the garlic (bawang), and julienne the ginger (luya). Cut the calabasa squash (kalabasa) into uniform 1-inch cubes and trim the long beans (sitaw) into 2-inch lengths. | Heat your large pan or wok (kawali) over medium heat (175F/80C). Add the cooking oil (mantika) and wait until it shimmers. Add your chopped onions first and cook them until they become transparent, which takes about 3 minutes. Stir occasionally using a wooden spoon (sandok na kahoy). | Add the minced garlic and julienned ginger to the pan. Cook these aromatics until you can smell their fragrance (hanggang mabango), usually 1-2 minutes. Add the fish sauce (patis) and cook for another minute, stirring to combine all the flavors. | Now comes the most crucial step - adding the coconut milk (gata). Pour the coconut milk into the pan slowly while stirring in one direction. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer at 185F (85C). Remember, never let it reach a full boil as this will cause the coconut milk to separate. Reduce the heat to low (165F/74C) and let it simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally but always in the same direction. | Add the cubed calabasa to the simmering coconut milk. Cook for 5 minutes or until the squash begins to soften but isn't mushy (hanggang lumambot nang kaunti). Test the tenderness with a fork - it should offer some resistance but not be hard. | Add the cut long beans to the pan. Cook for 3 minutes until they turn bright green but remain crisp (hanggang maging berde pero malutong pa rin). They should bend slightly but still snap when folded. | Gently place your steamed crabs into the simmering coconut milk mixture. Pour in the coconut cream (kakang gata) and add the Thai chili peppers (siling labuyo) whole. If you want the dish spicier, you can slice the chilies before adding. | Let everything simmer together for 8-10 minutes at low heat until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of your spoon (hanggang lumapot ang sabaw). Stir very gently to avoid breaking the crab pieces. The oil from the coconut cream should rise to the surface, creating small orange pools - this is a good sign. | Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper (asin at paminta) as needed. If you want more saltiness, you can add a little more fish sauce instead of salt. The final sauce should be creamy and rich but not too thick - it should easily pour over rice but not be watery. | Once done, let the dish rest for 2-3 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to settle and the sauce to reach the perfect consistency. Serve immediately in a large bowl with plenty of hot steamed rice (mainit na kanin). Place calamansi halves and extra fish sauce on the side for diners to adjust flavors to their taste. | Remember to provide finger bowls with warm water and calamansi for cleaning hands, as this dish is traditionally eaten kamayan style (using hands). The best way to enjoy Ginataang Alimasag is to crack the crab shells with your hands and use your fingers to get every bit of meat, dipping each piece in the rich coconut sauce before eating with rice.",blue crabs alimasag | coconut milk coconut milk | coconut cream kakang coconut milk | thumb size ginger | thai chili pepper | fish sauce fish sauce | calabasa kalabasa | long bean | oil mantika | salt and pepper

Maingat na linisin ang pusit - carefully clean the squid by removing the head, beak, tentacles, and transparent quill (backbone) from inside. Cut the squid body into 1-inch rings. Hugasan sa malamig na tubig - wash thoroughly under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. | Using a large pan set over medium-high heat (375F/190C), combine the cleaned squid, half of the minced garlic, vinegar, water, and bay leaf. Pakuluin ng hindi hinahalo - bring to a boil without stirring. This is very important as stirring will cause the squid to become tough. Cook for exactly 3 minutes. Drain the squid and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Set the squid aside. | In the same pan over medium heat (350F/175C), heat the cooking oil until shimmering. Igisa ang bawang, sibuyas, at luya - saut the remaining garlic, onion, and ginger until fragrant and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes and gently mash them with the back of your spoon while cooking. | Ibuhos ang gata - pour in the coconut milk and the reserved cooking liquid. Simmer until you see the oil begin to separate from the coconut milk (called litid in Tagalog), which takes about 5 minutes. This separation is a sign that the coconut milk is fully cooked. | Lower the heat to 300F/150C and return the squid to the pan. Add the sliced chili peppers and fish sauce. Pasingawan ng dahan-dahan - gently simmer for 3-5 minutes only. Be careful not to overcook the squid at this stage. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. | The dish is done when the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and the squid is tender but still has a slight bite to it. If the sauce is too thin, simmer for a few more minutes until it reaches your desired consistency. | Serve hot over steaming white rice. For the best presentation, garnish with toasted garlic bits (sinangag na bawang), sliced green onions, and serve with calamansi halves on the side. | To prevent the sauce from sticking to the pan, maintain low heat during the final cooking stage and stir occasionally. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can thin it out with a small amount of hot water or coconut milk. | Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

Pour oil into a large pan or kawali. Wait until the oil is hot but not smoking (Initin ang kawali sa katamtamang init). | Add your chopped onions and minced garlic to the hot oil. Cook them until the onions become clear and soft, about 2-3 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning (Igisa ang sibuyas at bawang). | Increase heat to medium-high (375F/190C).

Do the same with the pork liver (atay), but keep it separate. Soak the liver in milk for 30 minutes to remove any bitter taste (ibabad ang atay sa gatas para maalis ang pait). | While the liver is soaking, prepare your vegetables. Peel and cut the potatoes (patatas) and carrots into cubes slightly smaller than the meat. Dice the red and green bell peppers (siling pangsigang) into 3/4-inch squares. Finely chop the onion (sibuyas) and mince the garlic (bawang). Dice the tomatoes (kamatis) into small pieces. | Heat your thick-bottomed pot (kaldero) over medium heat (katamtamang init, 350F/175C). Add cooking oil (mantika) and annatto seeds (atsuete). Stir until the oil turns orange, then remove and discard the seeds using your slotted spoon (sandok na may butas). | In the orange-tinted oil, saut the chopped onions until they become translucent (malinaw), about 2-3 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant (mabango), about 1 minute. Add the diced tomatoes and cook until they start to soften and release their juices, about 5 minutes. | Add the cubed pork to the pot and cook until the meat browns on all sides (lutuin hanggang maging kulay kayumanggi), approximately 5-7 minutes. Pour in the fish sauce (patis) and stir to combine. Add water (tubig) and bay leaves (dahon ng laurel). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low (300F/150C). Cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes or until the pork becomes tender (malambot). | Once the pork is tender, add the cubed potatoes and carrots. Cook for 5 minutes at medium-low heat (325F/165C). Add the bell peppers and drained garbanzo beans (garbanzos). Drain the liver from the milk, pat it dry, and add it to the pot along with the raisins (pasas). | Cook for another 5-7 minutes until the liver is just cooked through (lutong-luto) but still tender, and the vegetables are crisp-tender (malutong-malambot). The potatoes should be easily pierced with a fork but still holding their shape. Taste and season with salt (asin) and pepper (paminta) as needed. | If the sauce is too thin (manipis), remove the lid and let it simmer until it reaches your desired thickness (kapal). The final sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remember that the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools. | Let the menudo rest for 5-10 minutes before serving (palamiginin ng kaunti bago ihain). This allows the flavors to settle and the sauce to thicken slightly. Serve hot over steamed white rice (mainit na kanin). | For leftovers (tira), let the menudo cool completely before transferring to an airtight container. When reheating (pag-iinit), warm gently over low heat (mababang init, 165F/75C), adding a small amount of water if needed to maintain the sauce consistency. Stir occasionally to ensure even heating. | Note: Like many Filipino stews, menudo often tastes better the next day (mas masarap kinabukasan) when the flavors have had time to develop fully.

Parboil the oxtail for 5 minutes in boiling water, drain, and rinse again to remove impurities (Pakuluan ang buntot ng baka ng 5 minuto, alisin ang tubig, at banlawan muli). Place in a container and refrigerate overnight. This step makes it easier to remove excess fat and results in a cleaner-tasting broth. | On cooking day, remove the oxtail from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature (Ilabas ang karne sa ref 30 minuto bago magluto). In a large, heavy-bottom pot, place the oxtail and cover with cold water. Add the star anise and bay leaves. Turn heat to high (100C/212F) and bring to a boil (Pakuluin sa malakas na apoy). | Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low (85C/185F) and skim off any scum that rises to the surface (Alisin ang bula na lulutang). Cover and simmer for 2-2.5 hours, checking occasionally and adding more water if needed. The meat should be very tender and almost falling off the bone (Palambutin ang karne hanggang halos matanggal sa buto). | While the meat is cooking, prepare your sauce base. In a dry cast iron pan over medium heat (170C/340F), toast the rice flour until golden brown and fragrant, stirring constantly. This takes about 5-7 minutes.

Add ginger and saut for another minute. Add diced onions and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. | Add the peanut butter and annatto powder to the sauted aromatics. Gradually add 2 cups of the hot broth from the cooking meat, stirring constantly to prevent lumps (Unti-unting idagdag ang sabaw habang hinahalo). Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. | Add the toasted rice flour to the peanut mixture, stirring constantly to prevent lumps (Idagdag ang tinostang galapong habang hinahalo nang mabuti). Add more broth as needed to achieve desired consistency. The sauce should be thick but still pourable, coating the back of a spoon (Dapat malapot ang sabaw pero madaling ibuhos). | While the sauce simmers, prepare your vegetables. Soak the banana heart in salted water for 15 minutes to remove bitterness (Ibabad ang puso ng saging sa tubig na may asin). Cut all vegetables into similar sizes for even cooking. | Bring a pot of water to boil for blanching vegetables. Start with the string beans (3-4 minutes), followed by eggplant (2-3 minutes), banana heart (4-5 minutes), calabaza squash (3-4 minutes), and lastly, bok choy (1-2 minutes). Drain each vegetable and set aside. | Once the meat is tender, remove it from the broth and set aside. Strain the remaining broth and add it to the peanut sauce until you achieve your desired consistency. Return the meat to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes. | Season the sauce with fish sauce and ground black pepper to taste (Timplahan ng patis at paminta ayon sa panlasa). The sauce should be rich and creamy, neither too thick nor too thin. | Let the dish rest for 15-20 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly. | Arrange the meat in the center of a large, deep serving bowl. Pour the peanut sauce over the meat. Arrange the blanched vegetables around the meat in a decorative pattern (Ayusin ang mga gulay sa paligid ng karne). | Serve hot with steamed white rice (kanin), shrimp paste (bagoong alamang) on the side, and calamansi wedges. Each diner can add bagoong alamang to taste, a few drops of calamansi juice if desired, and extra sauce according to their preference. | Remember to stir the dish gently before serving to ensure the sauce is well combined (Haluin nang marahan bago ihain). If the sauce becomes too thick upon standing, add a little hot broth or water and gently stir to reach desired consistency. | Remaining Kare-Kare can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days (Maaaring itago sa ref nang hanggang 4 na araw). When reheating, do so gently over low heat, stirring occasionally and adding a little broth if needed to restore the sauce's consistency (Initin sa mababang temperatura at dagdagan ng sabaw kung kinakailangan).",oxtail buntot ng baka | honeycomb tripe tuwalya | water tubig | oil mantika | peanut butter mantikang mani | rice flour galapong | annatto powder | onion sibuya | garlic bawang | japanese eggplants talong | sitaw | banana heart puso ng | bok choy pechay | fish sauce fish sauce | sea salt asin | black pepper paminta | shrimp paste shrimp paste shrimp paste
